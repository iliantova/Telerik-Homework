C# is a programming language, .NET is a blanket term that tends to cover both the .NET Framework (an application framework library) and the Common Language Runtime which is the runtime in which .NET assemblies are run.
Microsoft's implementation of C# is heavily integrated with the .NET Framework . 
.NET is library of code that .NET languages can talk to.
.NET languages come in different flavours such as: C#.NET, VB.NET, Managed C++, F#.
.NET languages compile to CIL ([Common Intermediate Language][1]) which means they all start "talking" the same language and can therefore interoperate.
