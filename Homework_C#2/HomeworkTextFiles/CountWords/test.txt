StreamReader class for Reading a text file
C# provides several ways to read files but not all are easy and intuitive to use.
 This is why we will use the StreamReader class . The System.IO.
StreamReader class provides the easiest way to read a text file , as it resembles reading from the console,
 which by now you have probably mastered to perfection.
Having read everything until now, you are probably a bit confused. We already explained that
 reading and writing to and from text files is only and exclusively possible with streams,
 but StreamReader did not appear anywhere in the above-mentioned streams and you are not sure whether
 it is actually a stream. Indeed, StreamReader is not a stream, but it can work with streams.
 It provides the easiest and comprehensive way to read from a text file .
