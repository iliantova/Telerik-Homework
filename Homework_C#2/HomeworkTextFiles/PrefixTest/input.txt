StreamReader Class for Reading a Text File
testC provides several ways to testread read files but not all are easy and intuitive to use.
 This is why we will use the StreamReader class. The System.IO.
StreamReader class provides the easiest way to read a text file, as it resembles reading from the console,
 testwhich by now you have probably mastered to perfection.
Having read everything testuntil now, you are probably a bit confused. We already explained that
 reading and writing to and from text files is only and exclusively possible with streams,
 but StreamReader did not appear anywhere in the above-mentioned streams and you are not sure whether
 it is actually a stream. Indeed, StreamReader is not a stream, but it can work with streams.
 It provides the easiest and comprehensive way to read from a text file.
